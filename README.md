# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER'

## Welcome to my github!

### 1st week

Summarizing the first week, we had to design a screenflow that complies with the following statement:

> _The Trackgenix SA company provides software development services to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that we will call "Trackgenix"  which facilitates the employeeâ€™s registration hours worked on each project and work team._

### 2nd week
On the second week, we designed the HTML structure of the landing page.
Here you will find the html structure inside of "Semana-02" folder with the name:
```
index.html
```
### 3rd week

On the third week we have added css styles to index.html.
We had as a challenge not to use flexbox or grid.
To be able to see the css's code you must access "Semana-03" folder, css's folder and here you will find the "styles.css" and "reset.css" files.

The html's styles are in:
```
styles.css
```
This file is used to format the default styles:
```
reset.css
```
