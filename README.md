# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER'

## Welcome to my github!

### 1st week

Summarizing the first week, we had to design a screenflow that complies with the following statement:

> _The Trackgenix SA company provides software development services to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that we will call "Trackgenix"  which facilitates the employeeâ€™s registration hours worked on each project and work team._

### 2nd week
On the second week, we designed the HTML structure of the landing page.
Here you will find the html structure inside of "Semana-02" folder with the name:
```
index.html
```
### 3rd week

On the third week we have added css styles to index.html.
We had as a challenge not to use flexbox or grid.
To be able to see the css's code you must access "Semana-03" folder, css's folder and here you will find the "styles.css" and "reset.css" files.

The html's styles are in:
```
styles.css
```
This file is used to format the default styles:
```
reset.css
```
### 4th week

On this week, we added css styles once again to the landing page but this time we had permission to use flexbox and the design had to be responsive.

We have ordered the styles in different files to be able to reuse them:

- header.css
- sidebar.css
- main.css
- footer.css
- styles.css

In the **styles.css** you will find the media-queries and the styles that apply in general.

To format the styles we use **reset.css.**
