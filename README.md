# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2ND WEEK PROJECT

## Welcome to my github!

Summarizing the first week, we had to design a screenflow that complies with the following statement:

_The Trackgenix SA company provides software development services to other companies, and has asked us to develop a web system that we will call "Trackgenix"  which facilitates the employeeâ€™s registration hours worked on each project and work team._

In the second week, we designed the HTML structure of the landing page.
Here you will find the html structure inside of "Semana-02" folder with the name:
```
index.html
```
